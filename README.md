# Coupon Management API

RESTful API for managing and applying discount coupons (cart-wise, product-wise, BxGy) for e-commerce platforms.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
uv sync

# Or with test dependencies
uv sync --extra test

# 2. Set up PostgreSQL database (choose one method)
# Method A: Using SQL script (creates database + tables + sample data)
psql -U postgres -f app/scripts/setup_database.sql

# Method B: Manual
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE coupons_db;"
uv run python setup_db.py

# 3. Configure database connection
# Create .env file with your PostgreSQL credentials:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/coupons_db

# 4. Run server
# Method A:
uv run python main.py

OR 
# Method B:
uvicorn main:app --reload

# 5. Access API docs
# http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** - Modern Python web framework
- **PostgreSQL** - Database
- **SQLAlchemy** - ORM
- **Pydantic** - Data validation

## API Endpoints

| GET | `/api/coupons` | Get all coupons |
| GET | `/api/coupons/{id}` | Get coupon by ID |
| GET | `/api/coupons/code/{code}` | Get coupon by code |
| GET | `/api/coupons/{id}/stats` | Get coupon usage statistics |
| PUT | `/api/coupons/{id}` | Update coupon |
| DELETE | `/api/coupons/{id}` | Delete coupon |
| POST | `/api/applicable-coupons` | Get applicable coupons for cart |
| POST | `/api/apply-coupon/{id}` | Apply coupon by ID |


## Use Cases

### Implemented Cases 

**Cart-wise:**
- Percentage discount with minimum threshold
- Proportional discount distribution across items
- Threshold validation
- Discount applies to entire cart value

**Product-wise:**
- Product-specific percentage discount
- Applies to all quantities of the product
- Product existence validation
- Discount calculated per product

**BxGy:**
- Flexible buy/get product arrays (OR logic - any combination counts)
- Repetition limit support (extracted from details and stored separately)
- Minimum quantity validation
- Multiple buy products can contribute to same offer
- Calculates total sets from all qualifying products

**General:**
- Coupon expiration dates (auto-set to 1 day if not provided)
- Usage tracking with `times_used` counter
- Repetition limits (max times coupon can be used)
- Active/inactive status toggle
- Comprehensive error handling
- Alphanumeric coupon codes (case-insensitive lookup)
- IST timezone for all timestamps
- Usage statistics endpoint (particularly useful for monitoring BxGy coupon applications)
- Automatic usage counter increment on application

### Unimplemented Cases (Documented) 

**Cart-wise:** fixed amount discounts, minimum item count, category-based, user segments, shipping thresholds, minimum/maximum cart value ranges

**Product-wise:** Multiple products in single coupon, quantity-based tiers, fixed amounts, max quantity limits, bundle discounts

**General:** Stackable coupons, priority rules, user-specific tracking, purchase history requirements, geographic restrictions, payment method restrictions, analytics dashboard, referral coupons, loyalty points integration, auto-apply best coupon, coupon notifications

**Edge Cases:** floating point precision, concurrent usage control, currency conversion, tax calculation, inventory validation

## Limitations

1. **Single coupon application** - Only one coupon can be applied per transaction
2. **No authentication** - Since this is only meant for coupon management microservice, auth can be added in future extension
3. **No user tracking** - Coupons not tied to specific users or user sessions
4. **No inventory validation** - Doesn't check stock availability for free products in BxGy
5. **No transaction history** - Doesn't persist applied coupons to orders (requires order management integration)
6. **No taxing system** - Discounts calculated on pre-tax amounts; GST services can be added as future extension
7. **Percentage discounts only** - No fixed amount discounts (e.g., flat $20 off)
8. **Simple BxGy logic** - Uses OR logic for buy products; doesn't support AND conditions
9. **No category support** - Products identified only by ID, no category/brand grouping
10. **No concurrent control** - No distributed locking for usage limits in high-traffic scenarios
11. **No audit trail** - No link between coupons and transaction which is limitation for coupon and usage tracking
12. **No rate limiting** - API endpoints not protected against abuse
13. **Case-insensitive codes** - Coupon codes are case-insensitive (SAVE10 = save10)
14. **Auto-expiry only** - Default 1-day expiry; no support for "valid until used" coupons

## Assumptions

1. **Product IDs are valid** - All product IDs in coupons and carts exist in the product catalog
2. **Single currency** - All prices are in the same currency (no multi-currency support)
3. **Positive values** - Prices and quantities are always positive numbers
4. **Valid cart structure** - Cart data is well-formed and contains valid items
5. **Pre-tax discounts** - Discounts calculated on pre-tax amounts; tax applied after discount
6. **No inventory check** - Free products (BxGy) are assumed to be in stock
7. **IST timezone** - All timestamps use Indian Standard Time (Asia/Kolkata)
8. **Decimal precision** - All monetary values rounded to 2 decimal places
9. **Auto-expiry** - Coupons expire 1 day from creation unless explicitly set
10. **Immediate application** - Coupons applied instantly; no delayed processing
11. **OR logic for BxGy** - Multiple buy products use OR condition (any combination works)
12. **Proportional cart discount** - Cart-wise discounts distributed proportionally across items
13. **Usage counter manual** - `times_used` incremented on application, not on order completion
14. **Repetition limit extraction** - BxGy `repition_limit` extracted from details and stored separately
15. **Case-insensitive lookup** - Coupon code search is case-insensitive
16. **No partial discounts** - Either full discount applies or none (no partial threshold discounts)
17. **Stateless API** - Each request is independent; no session management
18. **Synchronous processing** - All operations are synchronous; no async/background jobs
19. **Repetition Limit** - If repetition limit is not defined, then a coupon can be applied only once
20. **BxGy get product pricing** - Prices for get products are specified during coupon creation since free products may not exist in the cart at the time of application

## Error Handling

- **404** - Coupon not found
- **400** - Cart doesn't meet coupon conditions
- **422** - Invalid input data (validation errors)

## Future Enhancements

1. Authentication for Coupon Management
2. Stackable coupons with priority rules
3. Fixed amount discounts
4. Tiered discount levels
5. Category-based coupons
6. User-specific coupons
7. Analytics dashboard
8. Advanced Coupon usage history
